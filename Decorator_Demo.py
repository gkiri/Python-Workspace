def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_whee():
    print("Whee!")
    
say_whee()   
    
    
 So, @my_decorator is just an easier way of saying say_whee = my_decorator(say_whee). Itâ€™s how you apply a decorator to a function.
