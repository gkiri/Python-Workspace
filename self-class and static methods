Note:
1.self:
In general methods in class are caled with instances.when u call a method by default "self" is passed which represents instance.


2.class methods(instead of self we use cls here)

when u want to update class variables that are common between all instances of class.
eg:No:of employees in company

3.static methods

Here no keyowrds like self or cls.
These r like normal functions.Used as helper functions for class variables



__init__
  
    1. similar to constructor
    
super()
    
    2.Used to initialise base class members in derived class
